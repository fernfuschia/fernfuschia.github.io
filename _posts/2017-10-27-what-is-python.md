 One of the most widely taught programming languages is Python. Python is a <b>high-level computer language</b>. There are also 
 such things as <b>low-level computer languages</b> (aka. machine languages / assembly languages). Below is a breif comparison 
 of the two.
 
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th width="50%">High-level computer languages (HLL)</th>
    <th width="50%">Low-level computer languages (LLL)</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Platform independant, able to run on different hardware</td>
    <td>Platform dependant, must run on the same hardware with the same configuration</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run slower </td>
    <td>Run faster as they have less functions, classes, keywords etc and do not need to convert</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Easy to write, read and understand.</td>
    <td>Use either binary or assembly language, making it much harder to write read or understand.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HLLs use compilers or interpreters.</td>
    <td>Binary does not need translation as it is already machine code, however
    assembly language needs an assembler to transate to binary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HLLs are incredibly flexible with libraries, keywords, functions etc.</td>
    <td>LLLs are not as flexible.</td>
  </tr>
