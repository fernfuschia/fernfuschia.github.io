 One of the most widely taught programming languages is Python. Python is a <b>high-level computer language</b>. There are also 
 such things as <b>low-level computer languages</b> (aka. machine languages / assembly languages). Below is a breif comparison 
 of the two.
 
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>High-level computer languages</th>
    <th>Low-level computer languages</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Platform independant, able to run on different hardware</td>
    <td>Platform dependant, must run on the same hardware with the same configuration</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run slower </td>
    <td>Run faster as they have less functions, classes, keywords etc and do not need to convert</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Easy to write, read and understand.</td>
    <td>Use either binary or assembly language, making it much harder to write read or understand.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
